GRID MAKER

See it in action at http://gridmaker.herokuapp.com/

This is a quick hack to make those background images such as the ones you see
on http://www.subtraction.com/2004/12/31/grid-computi and
http://www.thegridsystem.org/. I've recently been reading about grid systems in
web design, and I'm trying to teach myself the fundamentals. But I discovered
that, especially when you want to experiment with lots of variations, drawing
such a background image is time-consuming. Or maybe I just have no photoshop
skills.

Anyway, I made this tool for myself and those like me, who want an easy way to
make grid-system background images.
